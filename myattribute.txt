
I'm fierce, daring, a lover of God, and love to help people. Talking and writing are self-expression for me. I love to see things through to the end, and excellence is a great deal for me in any project I find myself involved with, as the phrase "whatever is worth doing, is worth doing well" is a mantra for me. I have some flaws I struggle with, but I try not to let them define who I am because my creator made it clear that I'm wonderfully and fearfully made, so I see those flaws as strength. I'm yet to work on that, and in my differences lies my beauty and relevance
